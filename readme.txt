== Description ==

No Follow all external links. The nofollow is added last thing before page load.  This effects all code (theme and content).  This is not visable in the page or post editor because it doesn't take effect until the page actually renders.

**Added New Feature**

* Turn nofollow on and off with CSS class "follow"

If you do want to pass the link juice to a specific link add the CSS **class "follow"** example &lt;a href="http://riseofweb.com" class="follow"&gt;...  If the link has the class "follow" the rel="nofollow" will not be added.

Tell search engine crawlers to only crawl your website and pass no link juice to anyone else. Unless link has the class "follow".

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

What does nofollow do?

It tells web crawlers to not associate the link with your website.  It tells the crawler to not follow that link and or skip the link.

Why use nofollow?
If your outbound links are sketchy, or you don't like anyone but yourself, or you are just paranoid about outbound links.
